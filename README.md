# Hacker-News-Opener-Chrome-Extension

### Open the first 5 Hacker News links in new tabs

The "Hacker News Opener" extension requests access permissions to specific hosts to give users a full and functional experience when interacting with Hacker News links. These permissions are justified and used responsibly to provide a valuable service to users of the extension.

Host access permissions allow the extension to communicate with and collect information from specific websites related to Hacker News. This is necessary to get the most recent and relevant links from Hacker News, as well as to access the content and data necessary to provide the functionality to open links in new tabs.

It is important to note that host access permissions are requested only for domains directly related to Hacker News. These permissions are required to access the Hacker News API and get up-to-date data on the latest news and links.
